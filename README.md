# Info about the application and the project

The application has been written with flutter and released for android.

This project is, for now, non-profit.

I decided to start this project to create an app that would also respond to some of my personal needs and above all to practice with flutter and with the development of mobile applications.

So I decided to make this application free and public for everyone. 

Good use.
